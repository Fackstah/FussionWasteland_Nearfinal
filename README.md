Features so far :

2 secret treasure hunts that lead you on journeys across the land in a search for key assets to help your team ( look in buildings for clues)

Territory capturing , there are yellow areas around the map over towns etc capture them and claim them for your team ( stay on the area for 5 minutes to capture it)

2 new AI bases Drug smugglers and Gun runners , they have good assets and each have a custom skinned HMG hunter (be prepared for a good fight this AI use UPS)

2 medical supply buildings where if you stay inside the building for 30 seconds you will be fully healed (30 seconds is enough to breach the glass front and kill anyone inside to avoid abuse)

Houses and different buildings added around the map to give variance.

Manual Dead object clean up script in case you do not want to wait for the auto script access with 0 - 0 - 1.

NV's added by default incase of alpha Lighting bug (flicker them on and off to remove the blue/white light bug when alt tabbing somtimes).

Thanks to 404 & GOT for their versions of wasteland !
